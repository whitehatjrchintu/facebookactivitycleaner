  - Facebook have similar parameters for unliking posts, deleting posts, deleting comments, removing friends, deleting unfollowed, deleting searched and many more other activities. So if you want to only **unlike posts** just visit `https://mbasic.facebook.com/allactivity/options/?category_key=all&id=your_facebook_id`, select `Likes and reactions`, install/enable this extension and refresh that page. You can do this same for other filters.
  - Facebook have some setup user request limits so enjoy until you get this error:-

    ![restrict](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74552895/137329085-54a4c037-bc5d-4374-a838-e014e7f4d8c1.PNG)
  
  - Due to Facebook limit i would recommend to use this extension 2 times a week. Access use might lead to permanent account ban.

  - If you want to delete activity of current running month kindly select **This Month** on [facebook activity log](https://mbasic.facebook.com/me/allactivity/) page.
  - You can clear activity of **any month and any year** but you have to open every month manually. Suppose you want to clear September 2018's activity so just go to [facebook activity log](https://mbasic.facebook.com/me/allactivity/), click 2018, click September and wait. After cleaning September's activity if you want to clean October's activity just click October.
  - Will improve it timely. If you, especially "PROs", found any mistake or have any suggestion let me know i will correct/apply that.
